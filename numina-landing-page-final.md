# Numina — Landing Page Content (Final)

## HERO SECTION

### Headline
**AI-Powered Closing for Forward-Thinking CPAs**

### Subheadline
Your clients' data is scattered across emails, spreadsheets, and files. Numina pulls it together, validates it, and flags what needs your attention — so you can close faster and catch revenue others miss.

## PAIN POINT SECTION

### Headline
Small business books are messy. You're the one who has to fix them.

### Body
Your clients don't have accounting teams. They send you inconsistent data, missing invoices, and last-minute surprises — then expect clean books by month-end.

Worse: revenue sits in emails and gets recorded only when cash hits the bank. That means quarterly reports understate the business, valuations suffer, and investors see a weaker picture than reality.

You don't have time to chase every receipt. But you can't afford to miss things either.

## HOW IT WORKS

### Section Headline
Connect. Validate. Close.

---

### Step 1
**Connect your data sources**

Emails, spreadsheets, files, invoices — wherever your clients' data lives. Numina ingests it automatically.

---

### Step 2
**Numina validates, standardizes, and flags**

AI agents check every entry against your rules. Incomplete data? Flagged. Missing details? Flagged. Ready for review in real-time.

---

### Step 3
**You review and approve**

You stay in control. Nothing hits the books without your sign-off. See exactly what changed and why.

---

### Step 4
**Syncs to your accounting software**

Approved entries flow directly to QuickBooks or your ERP. No manual data entry. No copy-paste errors.

## THREE PILLARS

### Section Headline
One platform. Three capabilities.

---

### Reconcile
**Transactions matched. Automatically.**

Invoices, receipts, POs — Numina matches them to your ledger so you're not hunting for discrepancies.

---

### Flag
**Your rules. Enforced in real-time.**

Set your standards: missing descriptions, amounts over threshold, incomplete entries. Numina catches them before they become audit problems.

---

### Research
**Compliance answers. Instantly.**

Ask questions about tax rules and regulations in plain English. Get cited answers without digging through PDFs.

---

## TRUST & CONTROL

### Section Headline
AI does the work. You make the decisions.

### Body
We know accountants can't hand over the books to a black box. That's why Numina is built with human-in-the-loop at every step:

- **You set the rules** — define what gets flagged, what gets auto-approved, what needs review
- **You see everything** — full transparency on what the AI changed and why
- **You approve before it posts** — nothing touches the books without your sign-off

---

## SECURITY

## FAQ

### Section Headline
Questions you might have

---

**What if the AI makes a mistake?**

You review everything before it posts. Numina flags uncertain items for your attention, and nothing hits the books without your approval. You're always in control.

---

**What accounting software does it work with?**

QuickBooks today. We can integrate with other ERPs and accounting systems based on your needs.

---

**What data sources can it pull from?**

Email (Gmail), spreadsheets, uploaded files. If your client data lives somewhere, we can likely connect to it.

---

**How long does setup take?**

Most firms are up and running within days. We handle the integration and configure your initial rule set together.

---

**Is my client data safe?**

Yes. Your data is encrypted, never shared, and never used to train AI models. SOC 2 certification is in progress.

---

**How much does it cost?**

We're offering free pilots to qualified firms during early access. Reach out to discuss.

## COPY NOTES

**Voice:** Professional but approachable. Talk to CPAs like a peer, not a vendor.

**Avoid:**
- "Revolutionary" / "game-changing" / buzzwords
- Specific stats we can't back up
- Overclaiming on features not built yet

**Use:**
- "You" more than "we"
- Concrete language (emails, receipts, QuickBooks)
- Honest framing (early access, building with partners)
